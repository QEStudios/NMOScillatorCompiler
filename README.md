# NMOScillator Compiler for Furnace text exports
Compiler to convert Furnace compositions into NMOScillator-compatible ROM files.

This compiler takes a Furnace *text export* (a .txt file). To generate a Furnace text export, open the composition in Furnace and select File > Export... > Text tab > Export.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the compiler is specifically designed to work with text exports generated by Furnace **version 0.6.8.3**. Using a file generated by a different version of Furnace will show a warning message in the console, but the compiler will still do its best to use the file. If something doesn't work, first make sure you're using Furnace version 0.6.8.3 before making an issue on github.
